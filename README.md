# Prime computer
Welcome to the prime computer!<br>
This automatic C program computes prime numbers from 0 through 2147483647.<br>
You may want to enjoy reading the first values using the slow version, or simply unleash its power with the normal version<br>
This prime computer prints its results and store them in a file named "calculations_prime.txt".<br>
This way, it keeps on going when you launch it again.<br>
Have fun!
