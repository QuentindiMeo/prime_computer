<br>
Welcome to the prime computer!<br>
<br>
This automatic C program computes prime numbers from 0 through 2.147.483.647<br>
Passing it (or not) an argument, you may want to enjoy reading the first values, or simply unleash its power.<br>
This prime computer prints its results and store them in a file named "calculations_prime.txt".<br>
This way, it keeps on going when you launch it again.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

<b>WORK STILL IN PROGRESS, LOTS OF FEATURES YET TO COME.</b>
