Welcome to the prime computer!<br>
<br>
This automatic C program computes prime numbers from 0 through 2,147,483,647.<br>
Passing it (or not) some parameters, you may want to enjoy reading the first values, find one, or simply unleash its computing power.<br>
Discover all of its features by trying './prime_computer --help'<br>
This prime computer prints its results and store them in a file named "calculations_prime.txt".<br>
This way, it keeps on going when you launch it again.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
