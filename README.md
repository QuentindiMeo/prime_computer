Welcome to the prime computer!<br>

This C program computes prime numbers from 0 through 2,147,483,647.<br>
With or without parameters, you may enjoy reading the first values, find one, or simply unleash its computing power.<br>
Discover all of its features and options by typing './prime_computer --help'.<br>
This prime computer prints its results and store them in a file named "calculations_prime.txt".<br>
This way, it keeps on going when you launch it again.<br>
